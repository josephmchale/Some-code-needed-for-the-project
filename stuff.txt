C
	- C seems to be the way forward

Python Interface
	- none to hardly any documentation yet for
	- will be harder to program than SawScript
	- planning to move away from sawscript to python in a few year
		- However a lot of legacy code on sawscript so could take even longer
	- they have no prefernce on whether to use sawscript or python
		- main aim is to show upskilling of saw/python skill is possible with the project
	- project will be slightlty easier to do with sawscript
	- 1 year out

we created the c code foer hte algoirtm
they developed the cryptol specifcaton

together the saw specfication is wrote 





running cryptol
	- can run through dev containter
		- howver not as much configuarability
	- can run native through linux

running saw
	- can run through
	- dev containter
		- windows
		- docker
			-settings, resources, file sharing, add course dev containter
